More Privacy Options
====================

This is a fork of the [More privacy options](https://wordpress.org/plugins/more-privacy-options/) 
WordPress plugin.

It implements some changes that were necesarry to satisfy the following requirement:
 - Do something else rather than redirecting to log on invisible blogs (like showing a coming soon message)
 - Set default blog visibility option, being applied to every new blog
 - Send blog visibility changes to somebody else than just the super admin
